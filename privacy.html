    <h1>WallPiece | Privacy</h1>
    <p>WallPiece is a mobile app made by Laurențiu Rădulescu, that lets you send a picture to your partner that may or may not become their wallpaper, through a little game of rock, paper, scissors. Because my app will be used to share intimate moments,
        and because there are no regulations of content (so there can be sent any type of photos), your data is securely kept by me, and cannot be accessed by no one but you and your partner.</p>

    <h2> * Data Collection</h2>
    <h3>Accounts</h3>
    <p>My app use only your name, email and profile picture form your Google account. But you have the option to change your name and profile picture. None of your data is sent to any third party entity and is used only for app functionality and account
        personalisation.
        <br><br>To add a partner you have to type their username and look for them. If they have an account, they will appear on "New Partner" page and you have to confirm that thy are your firend.</p>

    <h3>Photos</h3>
    <p>I collect only the photos that were set as wallpaper, but as I said earlier NO ONE can access your photos but you and your partner. Along with the picture the app stores the time when the wallpaper was sent and who sent it.<br>You can access your
        history and delete/save any photo from there. If you cange your partner the photos that were stored are deleted and are lost EVEN if you add your last parner again.</p>

    <h2> * How I share Data</h2>
    <p>None of your data is sold, licensed or leased to third parties.</p>

    <h2> * How you share Data</h2>
    <p>Once you send a photo there are 2 possible outcomes:
        <ul>
            <li>you and your partner Tie and the photo is permanently lost;</li>
            <li>one of you lose and the photo is saved in your history and can be deleted or saved from there.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2> * Data Retention</h2>
    <p>I keep this data untill you delete your account or you change your partner. I do not have any legal obligation to keep it.</p>

    <h2> * Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the following rights:

            <li>Access, you can request a copy of the data that I have stored.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2> * Children</h2>
    <p>WallPiece is not intended for children, if I learn that children use my app I will delete that data and restrict that account.</p>
